I recommend using pak R package to install all other needed packages
This program takes in entry weight of soil sample
Calculates % of sand, silt and clay based on the user weight input
!!Work in progress - the sediment/soil type is not yet fully functional!!
The samples are then plotted on a USDA soil type chart available from the ggtern package
The graph can be downloaded, as well as the data table
Summary is also available and plain ternary chart with your samples
I hope to further develop this app and add following features: uploading your own csv data, 
more flexibility on which samples to plot, 
and most importantly a few different sediment and soil classification graphs and methods

Contact me for questions and possible collaborations!
