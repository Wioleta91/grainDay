How to use: Download the code grainDay and the helper scripts and run in R Studio.

This program takes in entry weight of soil sample and calculates % of sand, silt and clay based on the user weight input. The samples are then plotted on a USDA soil type chart available from the ggtern package. Both graphs can be downloaded, as well as the data table. Summary is also available and plain ternary chart with your samples.


!!Work in progress - the sediment/soil type is not yet fully functional!!
I hope to further develop this app and add following features: uploading your own csv data, more flexibility on which samples to plot, and most importantly a few different sediment and soil classification methods.


Contact me for questions and possible collaborations! 

This is the first Shiny app I built, be nice :)
